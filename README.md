* **What's Geekometer?**

 Geekometer is an add-on to help the user practice questions on Geeksforgeeks more efficiently. Geeksforgeeks, having an excellent question corpus for coding interview preparation, has a huge bunch of question links which might make it difficult for some users to track the topics they have done and prioritize topics. Geekometer helps to keep this track wherein a user can mark topics as "Done", "Prioritize" - based on different color schemes and "Prioritize and mark done"!
